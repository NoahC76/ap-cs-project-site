      <h2>Phaser Tag</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">mBlock Code</a></p>
      <p>In this project, my partner and I programmed a Microbit and attached accessories to it to make Phaser Tag: a
        homemade laser tag game that supports up to two teams. It utilizes IR sensors to detect incoming "phases" from
        opposing remotes, and it displays the current number of lives on the LED display of the Microbit. An invincibility
        period was added to each "phase" to ensure that all players have an equal chance to leave the area after being in
        an engagement. A buzzer was added to create a buzz whenever a player gets hit, and a potentiometer dynamically
        changes the volume. There is also a small LED to signify if the player has joined the game and still has lives
        left.</p>

      <h2>Paint App</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/899117223/">Scratch Code</a></p>
      <p>In this project, my partner and I coded a drawing app using Scratch. We designed custom inputs for different preset shapes, and added an n-sided polygon tool. This allows the user to create a shape with however many sides they wanted and at whatever size they preferred. There were also check systems to ensure that the n-sided polygon tool created shapes that existed and that the shape would not be too large.</p>

      <h2>Toy Train</h2>
      <p><a href="https://ndcengineeringportfolio.weebly.com/train-project.html">Train Writeup</a></p>
      <p>In this project, my team and I were challenged to create model train toys to fit wooden tracks and link to Thomas trains. We also had to stick to our circus theme while also having four unique parts on the model. We started off by creating rough sketches and then modeled them in Fusion 360. We created assemblies and imported different screw sizes in order to see what extra materials we would need to create the final product. Once that was done, we 3D printed a prototype and saw how our designs worked. With my train in particular, I found that the holes for the cowcatcher were not the correct size, the smokestack needed a larger peg to stay, the wheel holes needed to be slightly larger in order to spin more freely, and the holes for the trucks needed to be deeper in order to have a more stable grip on the body. We then adjusted our models to include fixes to all of these faults, then we printed out our final train and showcased them in a long line of trains combined with the rest of the class' trains.
